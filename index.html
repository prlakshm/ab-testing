        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>
          The objective of the A/B testing project was to experiment with different versions of a website and
          use A/B testing to find out which version is "better." 
        </p>

        <h2>How do we measure "better"?</h2>
        <p>We want 
          to create a smoother, more likable user experience, so we are trying to find the version that performs "better" in terms of user satisfaction and engagement. 
          I choose key metrics to observe and test to evaluate which version was "better."
        </p>
        <h3>Metrics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="color">Time on Page </span>- Time spent on page to complete the task. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="color">Number of Clicks </span>- Number of clicks on the page. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="color">If Misclicked </span>- A boolean value representing if a user clicked a button not relevant to the task. 
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Webpage Version A</h2>
        <p>
          I tested on a doctor's office webpage. We are trying to design this webpage to make it easy to book an appointment. 
        </p>
        <video width="780" controls>
          <source src="public/Version_A.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="public/a_html.png" alt="Original Version A of Doctor's Office Webpage" />
        </div>
        <p>
          The original version of the webpage has some usability issues:
          the <span class="color">light blue buttons are hard to see</span> and the <span class="color">appointment rows are not ordered chronologically</span>.
          Both these issues can make it difficult for the user
          to book and appointment. </p>
        
        <h2>Webpage Version B</h2>
        <video width="780" controls>
          <source src="public/Version_B.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
          <img src="public/Version_B_diagram.png" alt="Version B of Doctor's Office Webpage" />
        <p>
          This version fixes some of the usability issues and makes other small changes to the webpage. But is it "better?" Let's find out!
        </p>
