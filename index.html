        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>
          The objective of the A/B testing project was to experiment with different versions of a website and
          use A/B testing to find out which version is "better." 
        </p>

        <h2>How do we measure "better"?</h2>
        <p>We want 
          to create a smoother, more likable user experience, so we are trying to find the version that performs "better" in terms of user satisfaction and engagement. 
          I choose key metrics to observe and test to evaluate which version was "better" for the task of booking an appointment. 
        </p>
        <h3>Metrics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="color">Time on Page </span>: Time spent on page to complete the task. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="color">Number of Clicks </span>: Number of clicks on the page. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="color">If Misclicked </span>: A boolean value representing if a user clicked a button not relevant to the task. 
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Webpage Version A</h2>
        <p>
          I tested on a doctor's office webpage. We are trying to design this webpage to make it easy to book an appointment. 
        </p>
        <video width="780" controls>
          <source src="public/Version_A.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="public/a_html.png" alt="Original Version A of Doctor's Office Webpage" />
        </div>
        <p>
          The original version of the webpage has some usability issues:
          the <span class="color">light blue buttons are hard to see</span> and the <span class="color">appointment rows are not ordered chronologically</span>.
          Both these issues can make it difficult for the user
          to book and appointment. </p>
        
        <h2>Webpage Version B</h2>
        <video width="780" controls>
          <source src="public/Version_B.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
          <img src="public/Version_B_diagram.png" alt="Version B of Doctor's Office Webpage" />
        <p>
          This version fixes some of the usability issues and makes other small changes to the webpage. But is it "better?" Let's find out!
        </p>
  

        <h2>Statistical Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          All participants were asked to schedule an appointment with Adam Ng, MD at Morristown Medical Center on April 23, 2024 as their task.
        </p>
        <h3>Time on Page One Tailed T-Test</h3>
        <div class="stat-test">
        <p>Time on page is a continous variable (meaning the time spent can extend until infinity), so I knew to use a T-test. 
          I chose to test this metric using a one-tailed T-test, because I wanted to see if version B optimized the time it took to complete the task on the webpage. I hoped
          that version B would make it easier for users to book an appointment, so time spent on version B would be less than time spent on version A.
        </p>
        <p style="display: inline;"><span class="color">Null Hypothesis</span>: There is no difference in the time it takes to complete the task for Version A and Version B or Version A takes less time. </p>
        <p><span class="color">Alternative Hypothesis</span>: Version B takes less time to complete the task.</p>
      </div>
